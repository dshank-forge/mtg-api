# Magic: the Gathering API

## Motivation:
My motivation for building this API was to combine two of my passions: coding and Magic: the Gathering. 
This API shares some of my favorite cards and decks from Magic.


## Setup Instructions:
To install dependencies, run "pip3 install -r requirements.txt". Then run "source setup.sh" to export environment variables.
To launch the app locally, run "flask run --reload". To execute unit tests, run "source run_tests.sh". If you run the app 
locally, it will be available at: http://127.0.0.1:5000/. If you wish to create a local database with some test data, 
you can run "createdb (YOUR_DB_NAME)" and then "psql (YOUR_DB_NAME) < test_db.pgsql".

The deployed Heroku app can be found at: https://magic-the-gathering-api.herokuapp.com/


## Data Modeling:
### models.py
- There are two tables: 'decks' and 'cards'.
- The decks table is used to view MTG decks.
- The cards table is used to view MTG cards. It can also be used to create new cards,
or update/delete existing cards.
- The mtg_browser role and the mtg_publisher role can view both tables. Only
the mtg_publisher role can create/delete/edit rows in the cards table.
- Both tables have helper functions for inserting, updating, and deleting.


## Authentication:
### Roles:
#### mtg_browser: can view cards and decks
#### mtg_publisher: can view cards and decks, and can also create, delete, and edit individual cards

### Authentication instructions: 
Pre-generated JWTs for each user-role can be found in the setup.sh file. You can use these with Curl or Postman to 
access the API endpoints. Please run "source setup.sh" once to export these JWTs as environment variables so that 
unit tests can be run locally. If you wish to generate your own JWT, you can visit the Auth0 login URL below. 
Please note that by using this method to sign in, you will receive a generic JWT without any associated role. It
will therefore only be able to access the index endpoint.
